    <summary>Nether Wart</summary>
    <p>
        Nether wart is easily harvestable and can be found in various spots around the Nether. Use a Fortune 3 tool for maximum yield.<br>
        Coordinates provided below. Alternatively, explore the Nether and harvest until no more is found.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>529, 1203 (Yield: Approx 2 rows (18 stacks))</li>
        <li>373, 1129 (Yield: Approx 2 stacks)</li>
        <li>442, 1097 (Yield: Approx 4 stacks)</li>
        <li>790, 896 (Yield: Approx 9 stacks)</li>
        <li>1225, 1192 (Yield: 18 stacks)</li>
        <li>1130, 1126 (Yield: 3 stacks)</li>
        <li>1293, 1263 (Yield: 3 stacks)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should have about or more than 2 shulkers when finishing this run.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Glowstone</summary>
    <p>
        Bring blocks and an elytra. Pillar up and break the glowstone on top of Nether caves.<br>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The old patches of glowstone underground no longer work!
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Infested Territories</summary>
    <p>
        Infested Territories are filled with constantly spawning monsters. Custom loot tables replace standard mob drops.<br>
        Drops include: gunpowder, ghast tears, blaze powder, glowstone dust, slime balls, exp bottles, etc.<br>
        There are two types of Infested Territories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yellow Wilderness</strong> - Gear retained on death, but Unstable Loot dropped.</li>
        <li><strong>Red Wilderness</strong> - Typical wilderness rules apply, but tougher mobs yield more loot.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Infested Territories rotate every 2 weeks, starting on Truce drop, then every 2 weeks after. Check the world map for infested tiles - yellow or red: <a href="https://lokamc.com/map" target="_blank">LokaMC Map</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bring: health pots, strength, DBR, Ancient ingots for armor repair, shulkers for storage, and a bow may prove useful.<br>
        For protection, build a hut inside the infested tile using blocks and a door to secure your shulkers and buff up away from monsters.<br>
        Alternatively, buff up with strength, speed, and DBR for survival.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Resource Isle</summary>
    <p>
        Mining on Loka is a quick way to obtain money and diamonds. Each continent (Garama, Ascalon, Kalros) has three resource isles (RIs), each with different ore spreads.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Garama boasts the most condensed spread, making it ideal for quick ore collection.</li>
            <li>Ascalon offers a large amount of ores spread over a vast area.</li>
            <li>Kalros features abundant ores but is challenging to navigate due to ice

        <strong>Coordinates for Resource Isle Caves:</strong><br>
        Kalros RI Cave: 3178, 5132<br>

        2530, 5390 (for Kalros, "funny cave")
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        WARNING: Resource Isles are prime PvP spots. Exercise caution to avoid losing your items upon death. Ensure nobody follows you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Kit for Resource Isle:</strong><br>
        Invisibility is just in case you need to run away (pearling in lava and drinking is normally the best way to hide).<br>
        1 Shulker should be empty to store ores and the other should be full of pots.<br>
        Ender Chest should be full of pots.<br>
        Pickaxe needs to be silk touch for storage purposes (use Fortune 3 once you are back to your town safe).<br>
        Elytra is for getting to/from Resource Isle. If Elytras are disabled on that continent, you need to use a boat instead.

    <summary>Elytras</summary>
    <p>
        <strong>How to go to Dragon Island:</strong><br>
        Go to end docks and then to these coordinates: x = -983, z = 329.<br>
        Pearl into the End Gateway.<br>
        To get the elytra, you will need to kill the Ender Dragon. You can respawn the dragon by placing 4 crystals on each side of the bedrock platform. Then, you have to fight the Ender Dragon like you would in vanilla Minecraft (besides when the dragon is perching; use strength and go in with a sword because of Loka +33% damage).<br>
        When the dragon is killed, it will spawn a chest. You can get the Ender Dragon egg/elytra from killing the Ender Dragon.
